# Mork-up!

Upload an image of your hospital appointment print-out and the app will create a `.ics` file that you can add to your calendar.

These appointment sheets are usually handed to patients undergoing continuous treatment each week over a number of weeks. 

Here is a sample of a photo taken of one such sheet:
